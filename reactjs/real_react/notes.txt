rendering process can be divided into two parts
1.  Render Phase
2.  Commit Phase

diffing algorithm
reconcilation occurs between two phase of rendering

Ques 1: What is React and why is it used?
ans .
react is a popular js library used for building user interfaces (UIs) for web applications.
why
-   it's known for its efficiency,flexibilty and reusabilty in creating interactive UI components
-   it allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable pieces called components.
-   These components can manage their own states, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale apllications.

Ques 2: what is jsx and why is it used?
ans .
javascript XML
It allows to write HTML like code within JS
It is used in react to define the structire of components

Ques 3: What is React component?
ans.
reusable building block for the UI
it can be a class or function that returns JSX

Ques 4: what is the difference between state and props?
ans.
Mutabilty : state is mutable and managed within the component itself,while props are immutable and passed from parent to child components.
Ownership : components own and manage their own state,while props are owned and manged by the parent component.
Usage : state is used for inernal component data that might change over time,
while props are used to pass data from parent to child components.

Ques 5: what is prop drilling
ans .
process of passing down props through multiple levels of nested components
ex.
function GrandparentComponent(){
    const data = "Hello from parent"
    return  (
        <>
            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <ParentComponent data={data}/>
        </>
    )
}
function ParentComponent({data}){
    return  <ChildComponent data={data} />
}
function ChildComponent({data}){
    return  <GrandChildComponent data={data} />
      
}
function GrandChildComponent(props){
    return  <p>{props.data} in child component</p>
}

Ques 6: What is a React fragment, and why is it used?
React fragment is a way to group multiple elements without adding an extra HTML element to the DOM

Ques 7: How do you define and use state in a React Functional component? How are they different from normal variables?
const Counter = ()=>{
    const [count,setCount] = React.useState(0)
    const normalcount = 0
    const increment = ()=>{
        setCount(count + 1)
        normalcount = normalcount + 1   //  it does not incresed
    }
    return(
        <>
        <p>Count : {count} </p>
        <p>NormalCount : {normalcount} </p>

        <button type="button" onClick={increment} >Increment</button>
        </>
    )
}

Ques 8: How do you define and use state in a React class component?
Ques 9: How do you pass props to a functional component?
Ques 10: What are PropTypes?
PropTypes in React are used for runtime type checking of props passed to components. This helps in catching bugs and ensuring that the data received by a component is of the expected type. PropTypes were originally part of the React core module but have since been moved to a separate package called prop-types

Ques 11: How do you use props in a class component?
Ques 12: In how many ways can we export/import things from a JS Module?
ans.
two ways 
default  and named export/import
default
-   use it when we want to export something by default
-   multiple default exports are not allowed
-   we can refer to the default exported thing bt any name
named 
-   use it when we have multiple things to be exported from a JS Module
-   Named exports must be referred to by the exact same name while importing them
Ques 13: What is Virtual DOM?
a logical representation of the actual dom in the form of react element
a programming concept where a virtual representation of the UI is kept in the memory.
It is an object that has react element to represent the UI
Ques 14: Reconciliation vs Rendering?
-   Reconciliation: the process of computing the diff between the 2 VDOM
-   Rendering: The actual updation of the informtion in the rendering enviroment

Ques 15: What is the Diff Algorithm?
-   whenever the state or props get updated, an updated VDOM tree is generated.
-   Diff algorithm calculates the difference between the 2 VDOM's (the previous dom and the updated dom)
-   after calculating this difference only the actual dom is updated.This makes react capable of doing fast DOM manipulation.
